**Compatibility:** *Prusawire - Beta 1*

## Overview
The Y belt must be installed and tensioned properly to ensure smooth and accurate bed motion.

**Important notes:**
- Extra belt length has been specified in the BOM; it is expected to have some leftover belt afterwards.
- **DO NOT cut your belts** until you are 1000% certain you have done it correctly.  It's okay to leave a little extra length hanging out until final assembly and validation.
